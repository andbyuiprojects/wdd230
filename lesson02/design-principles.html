            <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. 
                Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information 
                easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users' perceptions 
                and guide them to desired actions. Here we see that the YAF has put their message and sign up right 
                at the start, big, easy to read and see, adn then other relevant recent articles bellow. </p>

            <p>Hick's Law states that the more choices a person is presented with, the longer the person will 
                take to reach a decision. Here on the google page when you go to search something there are very
                few choices as to what you can do, making it very quick to allow someone to make a decision.</p>

            <p>Fitts's law says that the time to move to a target depends on how big it is and on how far away it is.
                This correlates to how easy or how convenient it is for a user to select an action on the webpage, 
                such as selecting a button, or a short dropdown menu. Vans webpage uses large buttons to make it easy for
                the user to get to their desired selection</p>
